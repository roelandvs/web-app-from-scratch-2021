# Web App From Scratch
[link to the site](https://roelandvs.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2021/api_site/#launches)  

This project contains an application that shows the upcoming launches op SpaceX. The site exists out of an overview page of all the launches, and a detail page of each launch. This page contains specific information of the launch such as the crew, the goal of the launch, which rocket is being used etc.

The challenge of building this site is that it will be built without the use of a JS library or framework. 

## SpaceX API
To get the data of the website I'm using the [SPACEX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/). This API contains a wide range of information about SpaceX such as launches, history, missions, rockets etc. There is no authentication required to use this public API.

This API is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Space Exploration Technologies Inc (SpaceX), or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates. The names SpaceX as well as related names, marks, emblems and images are registered trademarks of their respective owners.

### Endpoints  
The base URL of the API is https://api.spacexdata.com/v3 or https://api.spacexdata.com/v4 depending on wich version you want to use. The API encourages you to use v4 (version 4), because they wont add new data to v3. Then you can choose to get 

The API has many different endpoints: 
- Capsules
- Cores
- Dragons
- History
- **Info**
- Landing Pads
- **Launches**
- Launch Pads
- **Missions**
- Payloads
- **Rockets**
- Roadster
- Ships

I'm planning to use the bold endpoints.

### Ratelimits
The API has a rate limit: 
- 50 req/sec per IP address

### API response
Each endpoint will respond with an array of JSON objects.
